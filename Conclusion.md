### Conclusion

In this article we have given a short summary of constraints-based approach to type checking that is the foundation of an upcoming major feature of JetBrains MPS. We have shown how this approach can be applied to solving a classic type inference problem in simply typed lambda calculus. This solution can be easily extended to support type annotations, and further to introduce subtyping and ADTs. A similar approach can be applied to solving  type inference in more conventional languages, such as Java. The author is currently working on re-implementing type checking for Base Language and its extensions, while keeping compatibility with Java and providing full support for solving type relations.

The method of solving constraints generated from the source code is not only relevant to type checking. One can imagine running all kinds of model validation using this technique, which is why we are planning to make the framework of building constraint rules as generic and as flexible as possible to allow for future reuse. 

We omit here the details of the implementation and the inner mechanics of constraint rules generation and handling, as this should be a topic for an in-depth discussion. All the source code is available online, so anyone interested in the details can take a look.
